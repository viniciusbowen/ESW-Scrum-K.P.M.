# 2. High-level objectives {#high-level-objectives}

\[List the key objectives for the iteration, typically one to five.
Examples follow.\]

- Address usability issues raised by Department X.

- Deliver key scenarios that showcase meaningful integration with System
  > Y.

# 3. Work Item assignments {#work-item-assignments}

\[This section should reference **either** the Work Items List, which
provides information about what Work Items are to be addressed in which
iteration by whom, **or** specifically call out the Work Items Lists to
address in this iteration. The preferred solution depends on whether or
not it is trivial for team members to find the subset of all Work Items
that are assigned to the iteration by using search methods, rather than
the Iteration Plan.\]

> Please see the Work Items List for Work Items to be addressed in this
> iteration.

> The following Work Items will be addressed in this iteration:

## Assessment against Evaluation Criteria Test results

> \[Document whether you met the evaluation criteria as specified in the
> Iteration Plan. This could include information such as "Demo for
> Department X was well-received, with some concerns raised around
> usability," or "495 test cases were automated with a 98% pass rate. 9
> test cases were deferred because the corresponding Work Items were
> postponed."\]

- ## Other concerns and deviations

> \[List other areas that have been evaluated, such as financials, or
> schedule deviation, as well as Stakeholder feedback not captured
> elsewhere.\]
