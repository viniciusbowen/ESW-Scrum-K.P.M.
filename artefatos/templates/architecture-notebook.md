# Purpose

This document describes the philosophy, decisions, constraints,
justifications, significant elements, and any other overarching aspects
of the system that shape the design and implementation.

\[Always address Sections 2 through 6 of this template. Other sections
are recommended, depending on the amount of novel architecture, the
amount of expected maintenance, the skills of the development team, and
the importance of other architectural concerns.\]

# Architectural goals and philosophy

\[Describe the philosophy of the architecture. Identify issues that will
drive the philosophy, such as: Will the system be driven by complex
deployment concerns, adapting to legacy systems, or performance issues?
Does it need to be robust for long-term maintenance?

Formulate a set of goals that the architecture needs to meet in its
structure and behavior. Identify critical issues that must be addressed
by the architecture, such as: Are there hardware dependencies that
should be isolated from the rest of the system? Does the system need to
function efficiently under unusual conditions?\]

# Assumptions and dependencies

\[List the assumptions and dependencies that drive architectural
decisions. This could include sensitive or critical areas, dependencies
on legacy interfaces, the skill and experience of the team, the
availability of important resources, and so forth\]

# Architecturally significant requirements

\[Insert a reference or link to the requirements that must be
implemented to realize the architecture.\]

# Decisions, constraints, and justifications

\[List the decisions that have been made regarding architectural
approaches and the constraints being placed on the way that the
developers build the system. These will serve as guidelines for defining
architecturally significant parts of the system. Justify each decision
or constraint so that developers understand the importance of building
the system according to the context created by those decisions and
constraints. This may include a list of DOs and DON'Ts to guide the
developers in building the system.\]

# Architectural Mechanisms

\[List the architectural mechanisms and describe the current state of
each one. Initially, each mechanism may be only name and a brief
description. They will evolve until the mechanism is a collaboration or
pattern that can be directly applied to some aspect of the design.\]

## Architectural Mechanism 1

> \[Describe the purpose, attributes, and function of the architectural
> mechanism.\]

## Architectural Mechanism 2

> \[Describe the purpose, attributes, and function of the architectural
> mechanism.\]

# Key abstractions

\[List and briefly describe the key abstractions of the system. This
should be a relatively short list of the critical concepts that define
the system. The key abstractions will usually translate to the initial
analysis classes and important patterns.\]

# Layers or architectural framework

\[Describe the architectural pattern that you will use or how the
architecture will be consistent and uniform. This could be a simple
reference to an existing or well-known architectural pattern, such as
the Layer framework, a reference to a high-level model of the framework,
or a description of how the major system components should be put
together.\]

# Architectural views

\[Describe the architectural views that you will use to describe the
software architecture. This illustrates the different perspectives that
you will make available to review and to document architectural
decisions.\]

## Recommended views

- **Logical: **Describes the structure and behavior of architecturally
  significant portions of the system. This might include the package
  structure, critical interfaces, important classes and subsystems, and
  the relationships between these elements. It also includes physical
  and logical views of persistent data, if persistence will be built
  into the system. This is a documented subset of the design.
- **Operational:** Describes the physical nodes of the system and the
  processes, threads, and components that run on those physical nodes.
  This view isn't necessary if the system runs in a single process and
  thread.
- **Use case: **A list or diagram of the use cases that contain
  architecturally significant requirements.
