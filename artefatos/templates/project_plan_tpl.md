1.  # Introduction

> \[Briefly describe the content of the project plan.\]

1.  # Project organization

> \[Introduce the project team, team members, and roles that they play
> during this project. If applicable, introduce work areas, domains, or
> technical work packages that are assigned to team members. Introduce
> neighboring projects, relationships, and communication channels. If
> the project is introduced somewhere else, reference that location with
> a link.\]

1.  # Project practices and measurements  {#project-practices-and-measurements}

> \[Describe or reference which management and technical practices will
> be used in the project, such as iterative development, continuous
> integration, independent testing and list any changes or particular
> configuration to the project. Specify how you will track progress in
> each practice. As an example, for iterative development the team may
> decide to use iteration assessments and iteration burndown reports and
> collect metrics such as velocity (completed work item points/
> iteration).

1.  # Project milestones and objectives

> \[Define and describe the high-level objectives for the iterations and
> define milestones. For example, use the following table to lay out the
> schedule. If needed you may group the iterations into phases and use a
> separate table for each phase\]
