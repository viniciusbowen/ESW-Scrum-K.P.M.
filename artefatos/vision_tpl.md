\[A product position statement communicates the intent of the
application and the importance of the project to all concerned
personnel.\]

# Stakeholder Descriptions

## Stakeholder Summary

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>[Name the stakeholder type.]</td>
<td>[Briefly describe the stakeholder.]</td>
<td><p>[Summarize the stakeholder’s key responsibilities with regard to
the system being developed; that is, their interest as a stakeholder.
For example, this stakeholder:</p>
<p>ensures that the system will be maintainable</p>
<p>ensures that there will be a market demand for the product’s
features</p>
<p>monitors the project’s progress</p>
<p>approves funding</p>
<p>and so forth]</p></td>

</table>

## User Environment

\[Detail the working environment of the target user. Here are some
suggestions:

Number of people involved in completing the task? Is this changing?

How long is a task cycle? Amount of time spent in each activity? Is this
changing?

Any unique environmental constraints: mobile, outdoors, in-flight, and
so on?

Which system platforms are in use today? Future platforms?

What other applications are in use? Does your application need to
integrate with them?

This is where extracts from the Business Model could be included to
outline the task and roles involved, and so on.\]

# Product Overview

## Needs and Features

\[Avoid design. Keep feature descriptions at a general level. Focus on
capabilities needed and why (not how) they should be implemented.
Capture the stakeholder priority and planned release for each feature.\]

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p>Need</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>Priority</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>Features</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>Planned Release</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><blockquote>

<td><blockquote>

<td><blockquote>

</tbody>

# Other Product Requirements

\[At a high level, list applicable standards, hardware, or platform
requirements; performance requirements; and environmental requirements.

Define the quality ranges for performance, robustness, fault tolerance,
usability, and similar characteristics that are not captured in the
Feature Set.

Note any design constraints, external constraints, assumptions or other
dependencies that, if changed, will alter the **Vision **document. For
example, an assumption may state that a specific operating system will
be available for the hardware designated for the software product. If
the operating system is not available, the **Vision** document will need
to change.

Define any specific documentation requirements, including user manuals,
online help, installation, labeling, and packaging requirements.

Define the priority of these other product requirements. Include, if
useful, attributes such as stability, benefit, effort, and risk.\]
